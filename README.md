# ft_printf
this is my second project in 42 cursus


it's about recreating some functionality of the original printf

Here are the requirements:

•Don’t implement the buffer management of the original printf().
•Your function has to handle the following conversions: cspdiuxX%
•You must use the command ar to create your library.

        •%c Prints a single character.
        •%s Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).
        •%p The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.
        •%d Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
        •%i Prints an integer in base 10.
        •%u Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
        •%x Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.
        •%X Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.
        •%% Prints a percent sign.
